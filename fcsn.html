      <p> A speical group of people who have been diagnosed with a disability
         have been brought to my attention that not everyone in the world
         is given an equal opportunity to do what they want. Since summer of 2014,
         I've decided to participate in a program that would give these people
         something special. Since swimming has been part of my life as a little kid,
         I've decided to teach these young individuals to love and enjoy the fun in
         swimming. Throughout the 9 weeks of this summer swim camp, kids have developed
         a passion for swimming. </p>

        <div id="contentpara1">
        <p1>Jeffrey has been a part of the FCSN swim camp for over 2 years. I was lucky enough to have him as a
           student for one week, but I wish I could have had him longer. Even though it was only a week, Jeffrey
           has demonstrated skills a lot of people don't have. He has mastered the strokes both freestyle and
           breaststroke. Each day, we would spend about 45 minutes in the pool. It would be 30 minutes of swim
           time and 15 minutes of social interaction. He also loves talking about Disney movies especially Finding
           Dory. Jeffrey is a very passionate and caring guy. </p1>

            <h1>Manson Lu</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="contentpara2">
            <p1>Manson is only 5 years old and has been with the program for a while already. This shows
               that nothing in the world can stop one from what one loves to do the most. In the summer of
               2016, I've taught Manson for 9 weeks. As the weeks went by, Manson became stronger and
               stronger. Although he is only 5 years old, I would say that he could do a lot more techniques in
                the water than me when I was 5 and definitely more than a lot of people out there. Everyday,
                Manson would be so eager and excited to get into the pool like nothing was in his way. I remember
                when I was 8 years old, going to the five feet deep area of the pool would be a scary thing. Manson
                is by far the bravest person I've met. He would have no fear swimming to the 5 feet zone by himself.
                We would have fun here and there, but most importantly, we would work on floats and breathing.
                When it would be time to leave, Manson would resist from getting out of the pool and want to swim
                more. </p1>
